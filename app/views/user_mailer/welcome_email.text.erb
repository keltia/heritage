Hey,

You can put your photos online in a few steps:

1. Fill up your name at <%= edit_account_url(:host => Settings[:admin_domain]) %> just so it looks
   nicer while visiting your website.

2. Create a story at <%= new_story_url(:host => Settings[:admin_domain]) %>, upload photos (you
   can batch upload using shift)

3. Change your website url at <%= website_account_url(:host => Settings[:admin_domain]) %> if you
   already own a DNS. Right now you'll be able to access your website at http://<%= @user.specific_url %>
 
Let me know if I can help.

<%= Settings[:admin_name] %>
<%= root_url(:host => Settings[:admin_domain]) %>
